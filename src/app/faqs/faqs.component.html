        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>

          I have a website but need it redesigned.
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        At this time, we <strong>DO NOT</strong> redesign any work that wasnâ€™t
        done by us. If you have a current website, you will need to have it
        redone completely by a member of our team.

          Will I have to pay upfront?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        The total will be made in three installments. For each 1/3 of the
        progress made, you will sign off on the changes and make a payment.

          How long will a custom website take?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      <p>
        The turnaround time for a custom site that is built without a website
        builder, depends on the client's requirements. We would need to schedule
        a meeting to discuss all of the requirements to give an accurate
        estimate.
